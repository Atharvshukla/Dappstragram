# Dappstragram
Dappstragram is a blockchain based Instagram like  Decentralised Application , working on Ethereum blockchain . Which allows the user to upload the images and Get TIPS on the images in ETHER cryptocurrency as same as likes . I have used Truffle Framework for the Development and written the Smart Contract in SOLIDITY and used CHAI for Testing my contracts . I have used WEB3JS for connecting the blockchain and the frontend website  while using ReactJS for the FrontEnd. and I have used Metamask extension in order to make my browser a blockchain browser  and most importantly I have used Decentralised IPFS for storing the images so the images can never be censored or taken down,
